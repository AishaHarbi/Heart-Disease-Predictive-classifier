# Heart-Disease-classifier

## Abstract

### Background: 
### Heart disease (HD) is one of the most common diseases nowadays, and an early diagnosis of such a disease is a crucial task for many health care providers to prevent their patients for such a disease and to save lives. In this project, a comparative analysis of different classifiers was performed for the classification of the Heart Disease dataset in order to correctly classify and or predict HD cases. We have two datasets of heart disease patients and non-patients, one from the UCI website and one from a local medical center in the city of Hafr Al-Batin. Dataset-1 contains a processed.cleveland.data file and a processed.switzerland.data file. processed.cleveland.data contains 303 person’s information and processed.switzerland.data provides 123 person’s information. Both files are in the form of a dataset containing 14 features and classification labels.  Dataset-2, the local medical center cardiac clinic, contains 8 attributes, but all published experiments refer to UCI public alone. The algorithms used K- Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Section 6.1 shows the comparative results. 
### Results: It was shown that using different classification algorithms for the classification of the HD dataset gives varying results in term of the classification F-score, accuracy and training time for the KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random forest classifiers. However, Logistic Regression has showed the best results with 88.46% F-score and 83.3% accuracy.
