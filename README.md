# Heart-Disease-classifier

### A supervised machine learning classifier that diagnoses patients as negative (do not have heart disease) or positive (have heart disease). 
### Classification in Machine Learning and Statistics is a Supervised Learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new observations or classifications. 
### Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating the mapping function from input variables to discrete output variables. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into based on local and global data of cardiac clinic HD patients and non-patients.
